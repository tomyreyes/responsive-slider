# Responsive Slider

This is a responsive slider built with [tiny-slider](https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider). 
I chose this library due to its simplicity. It is built using vanilla javascript without the use of jQuery or technologies such as React that I have been spending much of my time on in the last six months. This way I was able to refresh my skills in making UI responsive without the help of these technologies.

## Challenges 

With this library I ran into the issue of including animations when transitioning between images. This library requires users to set the mode to "gallery" to enable its fade in and out animations but this ended up making my thumbnail slider go out of sync with my main gallery slider. 

## Technologies Used:
