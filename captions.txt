It was a dark and stormy night…
Suddenly, there’s a knock on Mario’s door! Who could it be?
It’s Princess Peach, of course. She looks worried!
Mario inspects the letter brought by Princess Peach.
A blank sheet of paper…in the shape of a Toad?!
Mario drops the paper in surprise.
But something catches his eye!
That stamp looks awfully familiar…
Aha! Mario recalls where he’s seen that stamp before.
Postmarked from Prism Island, eh?
Next stop, Prism Island!
So…what are they supposed to do now?
